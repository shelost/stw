                “Gold has also proved itself to be an effective hedge against inflation over the long run. Roy Jastram looked at more than 400
                years of data in his book The Golden Constant, comparing the price of gold with that of consumer goods, and found that regardless
                of inflation or deflation, “gold holds its purchasing power remarkably well over time.” Gold is recognized as a potentially powerful
                tool in an investment portfolio. Gold can keep pace with inflation and offer a hedge against currency deflation. Gold is frequently
                used as a hedge against inflation.”

                <h1> Are All Hedge Funds Evil? </h1>
                <h2> December 17, 2010 </h2>

                One might ponder whether or not hedge funds are evil incarnate. The simple answer is “no.” Hedge funds can play an important role
                in diversifying any portfolio as I point out in Part 5 of Wave Theory for Alternative Investments. Similar to other alternatives,
                hedge funds can potentially be used to lower risk and increase returns. Hedge funds involve many different investment styles and
                can be viewed as an asset class not too dissimilar from equities or fixed income. They also tend to do well in challenging markets.

                As a whole, hedge funds usually do not outperform equities in a raging bull market but tend to do better than equities in a market
                downturn because they are “hedged.” Hedge funds have the ability to short or protect themselves in a down market as opposed to many
                long only managers that merely watch their assets plummet as the market plunges. Why the bad rap? While hedge funds are not evil per se,
                they are unregulated and there have been a handful of nefarious individuals that have helped taint the hedge fund world such as Bernie
                Madoff. The adage “A few bad apples” comes to mind. However, not all hedge fund managers are evil. There are many excellent hedge fund
                managers that exist. Because hedge fund managers are by nature defensive, they tend (as a whole) to have compelling risk/reward
                characteristics over time; they typically do not lose as much as some of the other asset classes when the market goes south. Hedge
                funds, as a whole, have returns that do not fluctuate as broadly as many other asset classes as reviewed in my book. For example,
                equities generally have more volatility.

                In Wave Theory for Alternative Investments, I show that hedge funds are worthy of an investor’s consideration. In 2008, investors
                around the globe witnessed one of the worst market crashes in history. U.S. equities (S&P500) returned -37%, European equities
                (MSCI EAFE) returned -43.38%, and hedge funds (HFRI Fund Weighted Index) returned -19.03%. Hedge funds were also subject to unusual
                events such as the U.S. government which imposed a ban on shorting, banks refusing to lend, and firms going bankrupt such as Lehman
                (that served as prime brokers for hedge funds). Even under these abnormal market conditions for hedge funds, one could argue they did
                quite well. Another horrific year for the market in recent memory was 2000 where U.S. equities were -9.1%, European equities were -14.17%,
                and hedge funds were +4.98%. 2001 was also a difficult time in the market where U.S. equities were -11.89%, European equities were
                -21.44%, and hedge funds were +4.62%. While many investors forget, 2002 was also challenging. U.S. equities were down -22.10%, European
                equities were -15.94%, and hedge funds were -1.45%.

                Are hedge funds guaranteed, risk free, and/or invincible? No. Hedge funds have risk as well as any security including U.S. Treasuries.
                There are no securities that are risk-free. Rather, there are securities that have less risk than others but none are risk-free.

                Bottom line is that hedge funds are a viable asset class that should be considered for any well diversified portfolio. As with any
                investment, an investor should review their income needs, risk tolerance, age, existing investments, and other variables before making
                any investment in hedge funds. In Part 5 of Wave Theory for Alternative Investments, I devote a total of 5 chapters to hedge funds and
                hedge fund-of-funds with the goal of attempting to explain how hedge funds came to existence, hedge fund waves, the present market and
                how it has evolved, advantages and disadvantages of both hedge funds and hedge fund-of-funds, performance, the different types of hedge
                funds, hedge fund indexes, ways an investor can access the hedge fund market, and how to perform proper due diligence. Responsible
                investing in hedge funds, can potentially enhance returns while lowering risk.
